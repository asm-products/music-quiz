# Music Quiz
Music Quiz is an app that leverages the Decibel API to ask questions about music.

## Dependencies

[http://nodejs.org/](Install NodeJS) to enable running the website from source locally and installing further dependencies with npm, Bower amd Grunt.

## Install this music quiz web app

```
npm install
bower install
grunt
```

Note on grunt: there is watch task that will wait for any change to Javascript files to rebuild the packages. This watch is to stay in its own terminal window.

## Run unit tests

The tests will re-run in the terminal every time a change is made to the unit tests.

```
./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start unit-tests/karma.conf.js
```

If a spec should be excluded, append "_Exclude" to its directory. For example:

```
mv ./unit-tests/spec/decibelAccount ./unit-tests/spec/decibelAccount_Exclude
```

## Consult the test coverage report

Once the unit tests are run, the test coverage report is updated and can be viewed as an html page.

Open index.html from:

```
./unit-tests/coverage/[your browser and OS name]/index.html
```
