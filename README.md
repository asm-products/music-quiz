# Music Quiz
Music Quiz is an app that leverages the Decibel API to ask questions about music.

## Dependencies

[http://nodejs.org/](Install NodeJS) to enable running the website from source locally and installing further dependencies with npm, Bower amd Grunt.

## Install this music quiz web app

### npm and bower

Install npm packages and bower libraries:

```
npm install
bower install
```

### Sass

Start the batch process that will watch for changes to the css styles and combine a single screen.css file from Sass:

```
open the directory ./src/css/sass/
double click on watch.bat to open it and start its process (Windows only)
```

### Grunt

If you haven't already installed Grunt in your development environment, do so:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Run Grunt automated tasks:

```
grunt
```

Note on grunt: there is watch task that will wait for any change to Javascript files to rebuild the packages. This watch is to stay in its own terminal window.

## Run unit tests

The tests will re-run in the terminal every time a change is made to the unit tests.

```
./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start unit-tests/karma.conf.js
```

If a spec should be excluded, append "_Exclude" to its directory. For example:

```
mv ./unit-tests/spec/decibelAccount ./unit-tests/spec/decibelAccount_Exclude
```

## Consult the test coverage report

Once the unit tests are run, the test coverage report is updated and can be viewed as an html page.

Open index.html from:

```
./unit-tests/coverage/[your browser and OS name]/index.html
```

## Run from source:

```
node ./server.js
```

Browse to localhost on the port that is being listened to.

## Run from source once everything has been installed

Each command in a separate terminal since they watch for changes (grunt and karma) or just run continuously (node):

node ./server.js
```
